Use wikipedia for lane emden equations to check your answer, has graphs of solutions for different n...

dtheta/dxi = eta
deta/dxi = -2eta/xi-(theta^n)

theta(0) = 1
eta(0) = 0

b)

Mass is integral of density with respect to volume

take derivative of both sides and use RK4 again instead of integrating numerically

dmhat/dxi = 4pi*xi^2*theta^n, mhat(0) = 0

Big M hat is little m hat for when you've reached the surface, Xi is for the surface of the star, when density is 0.

dm to dr is converting from mass to radius
take dmhat/dxi and substitute for dm/dr

DONT evaluate after theta <= 0!

di/dxi = 8pi/3 xi^4*theta^n
dw/dxi = 4pi*mhat*xi*theta^n

for first step, xi = 0, eta = 0, so just force it to be 0 in that case

modify RK4 completely to handle multiple eqns, look at faber's code

if xi != 0, do this eqn, otherwise set to -1/3

i(0) = 0, w(0) = 0, mhat(0) = 0, eta(0) = 0, theta(0) = 1


part c) is a little tricky
he will send us some notes on this one - the hard part is redimensionalizing dimensionless stuff with actual numbers from the sum

c is not a coding problem, it's taking the results from previous problems and using it for something (hopefully) productive.

V in white dwarf part is eta equiv, s is xi equiv. Don't forget the chain rule! equivalent of lane emden equation. Check what you get with Faber before proceeding.

c) for white dwarf - dmhat/ds = 4pitheta*s^2 - similar to last case.wait to get to surface, read off value, then plot.
A is a constant
