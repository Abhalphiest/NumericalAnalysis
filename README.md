# NumericalAnalysis

Numerical Methods written in C (C++ in the case of fft) for a Numerical Analysis class during my BS in Mathematics.

applications:
  solving the lane-emden equation and its' analogue for white dwarf stars (astrophysics)
  
approximations:
  polynomial approximation methods, including cubig splides, chebyshev curves, bezier curves, and lagrange polynomials

fft:
  fast fourier transform, used for a project on ocean wave simulations, available in a different repo

numerical calc:
  numerical integration and differentiation

ode:
  numerical solvers for ordinary differential equations
  
rootfinding:
  numerical methods for finding roots of functions
